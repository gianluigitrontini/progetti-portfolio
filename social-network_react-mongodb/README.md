# University Social Network

A kind of Facebook but for University. Just like Facebook was, but in 2021.

Not exactly a clone, but we can find a lot of similarities between the two.  
It includes:

- A 'Feed' to Share & View your friends' posts.
- A 'Profile' with your posts.
- A 'Chat' sidebar (functionality is still WIP) for chatting with Friends and with Classmates (even if they aren't in your friends list)

It was really meant for Universities, so you could find an area dedicated to online courses (and use it as a learning platform) to help with career orientation by organising all the courses in 'Paths'.
It also includes Events, so you won't miss any conference or party in your area.

It can be worked on a lot more, so consider this a huge W.I.P.
